# Pacman Factory Exercise
This game activity has two events with two click buttons. On the click of Add Pacman button, 
many pacmen can be added of various sizes. 
The startgame button moves the pacmen at random velocity across the screen, 
and they remain within the frame of the screen after bouncing off the edges.
